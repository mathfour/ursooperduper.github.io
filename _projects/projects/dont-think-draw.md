To help reignite my creativity and get back into the habit of drawing, I decided to embark on a project in 2014, drawing one character design a day. The drawing was posted on [my Instagram account](https://instagram.com/ursooperduper) each day to share progress and get feedback from my followers.

Periodically, I would take all the sketches I'd created and convert them to vector art. Then I'd add color and additional styling to select pieces. Some of the character designs that I was particularly pleased with were formatted to fit in t-shirt, pillows, phone cases, and more on the website, [Society 6](https://society6.com/ursooperduper).
