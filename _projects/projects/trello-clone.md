I wanted to start experimenting with various front-end frameworks, so I set out to build clones of some of my favorite applications. The first in this series of experiments is a Trello Clone. Trello is a tool that makes it possible to organize anything using lists, cards, images, and other data - in an easy to use drag-and-drop interface.

The Trello clone is built in AngularJS and uses basic styling to copy Trello's list and card creation process. It uses a popular lightweight AngularJS module to handle the [drag and drop interaction](http://marceljuenemann.github.io/angular-drag-and-drop-lists).
