When I first arrived at Hacker School, I decided I wanted to learn more about iOS development, Xcode, and Swift which had just been announced at WWDC. After learning some basics about Xcode and experimenting with Swift in Playgrounds, I started my first iOS project - a simple calculator. I chose this particular project because it's scope is well defined and I didn't want to spend a lot of time designing something new. I learned a lot about iOS project and code structure, as well as how to work with constraints in Xcode.


You can learn more about this project from the [blog post](/2014/09/17/basic-calculator-app.html) I wrote detailing its creation.
