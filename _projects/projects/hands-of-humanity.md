As a huge fan of the card game, [Cards Against Humanity](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com), I wanted an easy way to show friends what a typical hand in the game might look like. So I built a database of all the cards in the game and then created a simple app that draws a black card and the necessary number of white cards to show what the hand might look like.

It was fun building this because I was able to easily duplicate the look of the real cards. In the future, I'd like to experiment with creating an online version of the card game with a custom card creator.
