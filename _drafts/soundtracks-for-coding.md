You know the feeling you get when you're completely absorbed in a movie. A good movie draws you in with incredible stories that can take you outside your own life and into the life of a stranger, often a fictional character. A big part of this comes from the musical scores to those movies. Scores help tell a story. They heighten dramatic and intense scenes and leave us on the edges of our seats. A score can bring us to tears when a character is experiencing hardship. When the team wins, the hero is victorious, or when the poor kids manage to escape from pirates with the loot saving their ramshackle home, that poor dog is reunited with his owner, the triumphant music that accompanies it can fill your heart with so much joy that you're right there celebrating with them.
We're all the heroes in the movies of our livse, but we, unfortunately, don't have musical scores following us wherever we go. Okay, so Peter Griffin had his own soundtrack, and if you can rock it like he did, you need not read this blog post.

For the rest of us, we spend a lot of time in front of our computers writing code, designing wonderful experiences for our users, planning our next big project. While we sit in front of our computers, we might listen to our iTunes library, favorite CD (some of us still own these), or listen to a streaming service. What do we listen to? The latest release from TBoneDawg? That's cool, but what if you could transform all those hours in front of your computer, slaving away, into a truly epic moment in time.

Coding Soundtracks

What follows are a collection of loosely themed Spotify playlists with great musical scores. Follow them, enjoy them, suggest additions to them.

Try coding to the intense/drama plaulist and code while listening to songs from Skyfall or Mission Impossible. That bug you're fixing or code you're trying to refactor is transformed. You'll feel like you're hacking the mainframe or defusing a bomb!

Doing some research or starting to flesh out a project, try the curiousity or journey playlists for less intense, but emotion-filled songs of growth. THat montage is your favorite movie where the underdog trains really hard to get better at that thing the bully in town is good at, that song will guide you through your unit test writing, planning for the new feature you need to start building.

If you're having a rough day, just had your dream feature pulled, or want to wallow a bit as your untangle ten year old PHP that you're bosses nephew wrote "in a weekend because he's a genius"? The melancholy/introspective playlist is for you. I can't promise you won't shed a tear.

Feeling playful and excited about your new project, try the curiosity.

Have you just nailed that bug that's been eluding you the first few days, ship a huge new feature,  or refactor a piece of code that's been frustrating you? Crank up the celebration score and you'll feel just like Rudy did whe he was carried off the field at Notre Dame.
