title: "Hacker School: Week One Wrap-up "

I'm currently on a train headed back to NYC, ready to start my second week of
Hacker School bright and early tomorrow morning. I'm pretty excited to get
back to work, but thought it would be fun to reflect on the past week and share
what it was like.

In the weeks leading up to Hacker School, I thought I'd would spend my time
focused on building essential computer science competencies and would learn as
much about Ruby as I possibly could. I thought it would be fun to build an
app that would help music fans learn more about the artists in their collection
and what their collection might say about them.

But the night before Hacker School started, something new popped into my head.
In my product and design roles so far, I've never had the opportunity to focus
on mobile, and this might be the chanc I'd been waiting for to get started. So
altering course slightly, I'll still work in Ruby at times, but my focus at
Hacker School will be learning how to build iOS apps - specifically learning
Swift and Xcode.
