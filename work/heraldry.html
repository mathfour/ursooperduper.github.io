<p>I've always been interested in technology that brings art and code together. I love to experiment with Processing, the language and sketchbook for visual arts.</p>
<p>When I found out Joshua Davis was going to be providing classes on Processing and the HYPE Framework via Skillshare, I jumped at the chance to take part.</p>
<p>The Heraldry project was born during that first class. I was looking for interesting symbols and designs I could use for generative art pieces and stumbled across the incredible symbols and imagery associated with heraldry.</p>
<p>As a part of this project, I created all my own SVG artwork and used that to create the pieces shown below.</p>
