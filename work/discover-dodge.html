<p>At Organic, I had the pleasure of working with a small team tasked with launching the Dodge brand overseas. We were to create a website, called Discover Dodge, to share information about the brand and its history. The website would need to be delivered in more than twenty languages, which meant that hard-coding text in the Flash app would be a poor approach.</p>
<p>Instead, we built a side-by-side translation tool that sat on top of a powerful content management tool. Local market translators were able to log in and translate content in the app while viewing designs for context. Through the tool, we could manage translation progress, and when a translation was complete for a given language, we could export all the strings to XML for use in the Flash website.</p>
<p>The Flash-based site was written entirely in ActionScript, loading assets and translated content from external libraries as needed. The entire layout was designed and coded in a way that let it adjust and resize to support whatever language was being displayed.</p>
<p>With such a flexible Flash site and process for integrating new languages, we could add a new language, test, and deploy the new content in under an hour.</p>
<p>The project was a runner up for Organic's Exceptional Experience award for it's clever architecture and translation processes.</p>
