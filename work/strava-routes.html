<p>Routes provide athletes with ways to plan and share their rides and runs with others.</p>
<p>Once a route has been created, it can be exported to a GPS device, printed as a cue sheet, and most importantly, shared with others, inside and outside of Strava.</p>
<p>The goal for the design of routes was to create something clean and simple that could be built upon over time. The actual route page has a flexible hierarchy that will allow for future expansion and features like photos, stories, ratings, and comments.</p>
<p>Route pages are made available to logged-out users in a basic form - showing just the map with a route path. If a logged-out user attempts to save or export a route page, they are prompted to sign up for Strava to gain full access to the routes feature.</p>
