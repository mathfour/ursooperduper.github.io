<p>Au Creative Group was a small, boutique agency with lots of small projects and lots of clients. We were constantly sharing deliverables with clients and had the challenge of making that delivery process easy for both our clients and team members. We needed a simple consistent way to share assets, manage review processes, and gather feedback throughout the lifetime of a project.</p>
<p>So I designed and built a custom Ruby on Rails app that allowed my team at Au to post assets of all types (audio, video, copy, art, etc.) to share with clients. Each client had a login that allowed them to see the latest assets, changes from one design to the next, and then provide feedback all in one place. When a deliverable or project was approved, the corresponding assets were tagged as final and easily downloadable from the app.</p>
