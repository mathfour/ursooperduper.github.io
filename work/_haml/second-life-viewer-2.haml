%p< The redesign of the Second Life Viewer had three main goals:

%ul
  %li< To clean up an aging codebase with a more modular system designed for future growth.
  %li< To make it easier for new users to learn the tools.
  %li< To better organize the Viewer UI.

%p< The project involved grouping and redesigning all the tools in the Viewer around key user interactions inworld: exploring, socializing, building, etc. Avoiding long specification documents, I developed a detailed annotated wireframes that served as a guide throughout the development process and working with various design and development teams to implement the changes.
