<p>Athletes on Strava compete and compare their performance on stretches of road called Segments. One of the challenges with Segments was keeping track of favorites. Most users bookmarked favorite segment pages so they could easily reference them, but it wasn't the best of workarounds.</p>
<p>Starred Segments were introduced as a way of collecting a list of favorite segments and presenting them in a format where you could view best times and your own personal bests. As new features on Strava were developed, they also integrated with starred segments, allowing athletes to set and view goals against their favorite segments.</p>
<p>The design for Starred Segments was built based on user interviews where I dove into the type of data athletes most cared about when looking at a Segment.</p>
<p>The end result is a straight-forward tabular layout with the information most relevant to the Athlete.</p>
