<p>Microsoft approached Vectorform about creating a Jib-Jab style series of short cartoons for a security-docused developer conference. They provided scripts, custom sound design, and music composition for the project.</p>
<p>I created each of the characters in Photoshop using found-artwork and photos of coworkers and friends as characters. I sketched storyboards for each of the six episodes of 30 second cartoons. Once the storyboards had been approved, I animated each cartoon Flash. We ended up with a funny story about of white hat cowboys (the good guys) defending their growing ranch from black-hats (hackers) by beefing up security with Microsoft technologies.</p>
