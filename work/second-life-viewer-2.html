<p>The redesign of the Second Life Viewer had three main goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To clean up an aging codebase with a more modular system designed for future growth.</li>
  <li>To make it easier for new users to learn the tools.</li>
  <li>To better organize the Viewer UI.</li>
</ul>
<p>The project involved grouping and redesigning all the tools in the Viewer around key user interactions inworld: exploring, socializing, building, etc. Avoiding long specification documents, I developed a detailed annotated wireframes that served as a guide throughout the development process and working with various design and development teams to implement the changes.</p>
