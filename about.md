About the Blog
--------------

I'm making at a turning point in my career. I'm moving from a focus on design
and product to engineering. To help with that change, I'm attending Hacker
School this fall where I'll be focused on learning iOS development with Xcode
and Swift.

I'll be sharing my experiences at Hacker School, interesting things I'm learning
about Swift and other technologies, and details of the projects I'm working on.

If you have questions, please reach out to me on Twitter!


About Me
--------

Ever since I was a small child, I've been set on proving to those around me
that I could and would do whatever I set my sights on - no matter what. I was
going to be the girl who could throw a baseball and kick a soccer ball properly,
and always keep up with the boys. When my father brought home our first
computer, the ZX81 and later a Commodore 64, I was going to master it as well as
my brother would.


I was pretty stubborn about all of this. I always chose the most difficult
projects and read the books people told me to avoid (but seriously, how
good was War and Peace?!). I'd listen to music none of my friends were
listening to - just to do something different. I wanted to stand out and I
wanted to learn as much as I could.


That has certainly carried on into my adult life. I've explored a lot of
roles in tech, from web design and development to tech leads, user experience
design, and product management. I'm always learning something new - a new
way of organizing work, a new framework or technology, and experimenting with
whatever new tech gadgets I can get my hands on.


I love to make things.

Lately, I've been drawing _a lot_ and having fun with character design. That's
lead me to experimenting with molding and casting my own resin toys. But I also
enjoy generative art and experimenting with Processing and HYPE and seeing
what sorts of interesting imagery I can create with my ever-growing custom vector
art library.

I also love to code. In fact, if I can pair code and art, I'm at my happiest.
Most often, I code with Ruby (and Sinatra, Haml, Sass, and PostgresSQL). But I'm
now learning iOS app development (with Xcode and Sinatra).


Outside of code and art. I love music. So give me something that combines art,
code, and music - and I'll follow you anywhere. I enjoy many types of music and
love to sing, play guitar and ukelele, as well experiencing as much live
music as I can.

To get me up and out of my studio, I love bicycling. I love to ride, build, and
talk about bikes and love to watch pro cycling on TV when it's available.


If you'd made it this far, you'll see that I'm quite a piece of work. To top it
all off, I'm a Canadian, born to British parents, and now live happily in the USA.

I'll sign off here and let you take it away with the Canadian jokes.

Eh?
