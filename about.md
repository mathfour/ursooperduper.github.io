The Blog
--------

I'm a tinkerer. A generalist. I love to build things.

In the fall of 2014, I was accepted to and attended Hacker School (now [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com)), where I spent a blissful ten weeks focused on learning iOS development with Xcode and Swift, and later focused on app development with JavaScript.

I started this blog to document and share my experience at Hacker School, projects I was working on and tips on workflow productivity (I <3 tmux). However, at the beginning of 2015, everything I was working towards was put on hold when I received a stage 3 colon cancer diagnosis.

After numerous surgeries, chemotherapy, and assorted illnesses, in the fall of 2015, I'm on the road to recovery and back to making things!

More on Me
----------

Ever since I was a small child, I pushed myself to do anything I set on mind on doing. I wanted to be the girl who could throw a baseball properly and never be picked last for the team. When my father brought home our first computer, the ZX81 and later a Commodore 64, I wanted to be as good at it as my brother and father.

This approach extended to academics as well. I always chose the most difficult projects and read the books people told me to avoid.

This has been true of my career as well. I've held many roles in tech, from web design and development to engineering management, user experience design, and product management. I'm always learning something new and that motivates and drives me.

I'm a great product manager. I love working at the intersection of UX, tech, and business. I thrive on data, roadmaps, and understanding users.

Outside of tech, I'm an avid illustrator/character designer. In 2014, I started a project called, "Don't think, draw", where I drew a character design each day and shared it on Instagram and later, Dribbble. With a lot of positive feedback on my drawings, I decided to experiment with creating molds and learned how to cast my own resin toys. I also enjoy experimenting with generative art with Processing, to create and manipulate artwork.

And of course, I love to code. In fact, if I can pair code and art, I'm at my happiest. Javascript, Ruby, Sinatra, Haml, Sass, Jekyll, PostgresSQL, Processing are my main tools. I've also been learning iOS app development (with Xcode and Swift). I've created a couple of apps that are documented on this blog and am working on an idea for the first app I'll actually submit to the app store.

I also love music (sing/listen/uke/guitar), cycling (riding/watching/building bikes), and reading. More on those another time.

If you're reading this (and thanks for that), I'd love to hear from you. Contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ursooperduper).
