The Blog
--------

I'm making at a turning point in both my career and my life. After a move to the east coast from San Francisco, I decided it was time to consider a move away from product management to more hands-on roles in the area of either front-end development or product design.

I love to design and build things. And over the years, I've found I'm happiest when I'm building a prototype or working on a web app. I had started my career in tech this way, and it's something I really want to get back into.

In the fall of 2014, I attended Hacker School (now [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com)), where I spent a blissful ten weeks focused on learning iOS development with Xcode and Swift, and later app development with Javascript.

I started this blog to document and share experiences at Hacker School, projects I was working on, and tips on workflow productivity (I <3 tmux), but at the beginning of 2015, my job search and projects had to be put on hold when I received a stage 3 colon cancer diagnosis. After numerous surgeries, chemotherapy, and assorted illnesses, in the fall of 2015, I'm on the road to recovery and even more determined to make my career shift and get back to doing the things I love to do every day.

More on Me
--------

Ever since I was a small child, I've been hell bent on proving that I could and would do whatever I set my sights on - no matter what. I wanted to be the girl who could throw a baseball properly and never be picked last for the team. When my father brought home our first computer, the ZX81 and later a Commodore 64, I wanted to be as good at it as my brother and father.

This extended to academics as well. I always chose the most difficult projects and read the books people told me to avoid (and a result, fell in love with books like War and Peace). I was constantly pushing myself.

This has been true of my career as well. I've held many roles in tech, from web design and development to engineering management, user experience design, and product management. I'm always learning something new and I love that.

I love to make things.

Outside of tech, I'm an avid illustrator/character designer. In 2014, I started a project called, "Don't think, draw", where I drew a character design each day and shared it on Instagram and later, Dribbble. With a lot of positive feedback on my drawings, I decided to experiment with creating molds and learned how to cast my own resin toys. I also enjoy experimenting generative art frameworks, like Processing, to create and manipulate artwork.

And of course, I love to code. In fact, if I can pair code and art, I'm at my happiest. Javascript, Ruby, Sinatra, Haml, Sass, Jekyll, PostgresSQL, Processing are my main tools. I've also been learning iOS app development (with Xcode and Swift). I've created a couple of apps that are documented on this blog and am working on an idea for the first app I'll actually submit to the app store.

Outside of code and art. I love music (sing/listen/uke/guitar), cycling (riding/watching/building bikes), and reading. More on those another time.
