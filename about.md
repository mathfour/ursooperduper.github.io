The Blog
--------

I'm making at a turning point in my career. I'm moving from a focus on product
and design to engineering. To help with that change, I'm attending Hacker
School this fall where I'll be focused on learning iOS development with Xcode
and Swift.

I'll be sharing my experiences at Hacker School, interesting things I'm learning
about Swift and other technologies, and details of the projects I'm working on.

Me
--------

Ever since I was a small child, I've been hell bent on proving that I could
and would do whatever I set my sights on - no matter what. I wanted to be the
girl who could throw a baseball properly and never be picked last for the team.
When my father brought home our first computer, the ZX81 and later a Commodore
64, I wanted to be as good at it as my brother and father were.

This extended to academics as well. I always chose the most difficult
projects and read the books people told me to avoid (and a result, fell in love
with books like War and Peace). I was constantly pushing myself.

This has been true of my career as well. I've held many roles in tech, from web
design and development to engineering management, user experience
design, and product management. I'm always learning something new -
ways of organizing work or a framework or technology.

I love to make things.

Over the past year, I've started drawing again and have been having a lot of
fun with character design. That's led me to experiment with creating molds to
cast my own resin toys. I also enjoy experimenting generative art frameworks, like
Processing, to create artwork.

And I love to code. In fact, if I can pair code and art, I'm at my happiest.
Ruby (and Sinatra, Haml, Sass, and PostgresSQL) or Processing are my main tools.
But I'm now learning iOS app development (with Xcode and Swift).

Outside of code and art. I love music (sing/listen/uke/guitar), cycling
(riding/watching), and reading. More on those another time.

So that's a bit about me - a geeky Canadian kid living in the USA.  

Eh?
