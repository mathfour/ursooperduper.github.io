1Password is arguably the best password manager available today. I've been using it for years on both my desktop and iPhone. With integrations for all major browsers and a well-designed desktop app, 1Password makes password management a snap. Keeping your logins organized and up to date with 1Password and mastering a few simple keyboard shortcuts will increase your enjoyment using this tool even more!
