[Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) is fast and a pleasure to use when I'm working on a development project. I especially love its responsive design mode. Learning some keyboard shortcuts for Safari will help you navigate between tabs, call up a search, and get your development work done faster than ever before.

[You can check out the full Safari Cheatsheet here.](http://ursooperduper.github.io/cheatsheets/safari/)

And below are a few of my favorite Safari shortcuts:

| ----- | ----- |
| ```⌥ ⌘ F``` |	Google Search |
| ```⌥ ⌘ R```	| Enter Responsive Design Mode |
| ```⌘ /``` |	Toggle Status Bar |
| ```⇧ ⌘ L``` |	Toggle Sidebar |
| ```⇧ ⌘ \``` |	Toggle Show All Tabs |
| ```⌘ Y``` |	Toggle History |
| ```⌘ [``` |	Back |
| ```⌘ ]``` |	Forward |
| ```⌃ ⇧ ⇥``` | Show Previous Tab |
| ```⇧ ⇥``` | Show Next Tab |
|  |  |
