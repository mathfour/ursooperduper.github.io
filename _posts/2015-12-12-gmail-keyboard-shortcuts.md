Who doesn't use [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) these days? Whether for work or personal email, it's hard to avoid Gmail. So why not learn some keyboard shortcuts for a tool you interact with all day long?

[You can check out the full Gmail Cheatsheet here.](http://ursooperduper.github.io/cheatsheets/gmail/)

And below are a few of my favorite Gmail shortcuts:
