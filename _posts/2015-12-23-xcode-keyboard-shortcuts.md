[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is the primary development tool for an iOS developer. When I was learning mobile development, learning a core set of keyboard shortcuts for Xcode helped take some of the complication out of this dense tool and keep me focused on my work.

[You can check out the full Xcode Cheatsheet here.](http://ursooperduper.github.io/cheatsheets/xcode/)

And below are a few of my favorite Xcode shortcuts:

| ----- | ----- |
| ```⌘ B``` | Build |
| ```⇧ ⌘ B``` | Analyze |
| ```⌘ R``` | Run |
| ```⌘ I``` | Profile |
| ```⌘ U``` | Test |
| ```⇧ ⌘ K``` | Clean |
| ```⌃ ⇧ ⌘ W``` | Remove Assistant Editor |
| ```⌘ ↩``` | Show Standard Editor |
| ```⌥ ⌘ ↩``` | Show Assistant Editor |
| ```⌃ ⌘ M``` | Show All Issues |
|  |  |
