[iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/) is my favorite Terminal replacement for OS X. Because working in a terminal window is a part of most developer workflows, it's a good idea to learn some keyboard shortcuts to speed up you interaction with this critical tool.

[You can check out the full iTerm Cheatsheet here.](http://ursooperduper.github.io/cheatsheets/google-docs/)

And below are a few of my favorite iTerm shortcuts:

| ----- | ----- |
| ```⌥ ⇧ ⌘ V``` | Vertical Split |
| ```⌥ ⇧ ⌘ H``` |	Horizontal Split |
| ```⇧ ⌘ A``` |	Select Output of Last Command |
| ```⇧ ⌘ H``` |	Open Paste History |
| ```⌥ ⌘ /``` |	Open Recent Directories |
| ```⌥ ⌘ U``` |	Find URLs |
| ```⌘ ↩```	| Toggle Fullscreen |
| ```⇧ ⌘ E``` |	Show Timestamps |
| ```⇧ ⌘ ↩``` |	Maximize Active Pane |
|  |  |
