## Dictionary

OS X has built-in dictionaries and with Alfred, you can quickly look up work definitions by toggling Alfred (```OPT + Space```) followed by the keyword, ```define``` and then the word you would like defined. The definition of matched words are displayed in Alfred's result list.

Another built-in Alfred feature is spelling. Just toggle Alfred, enter the keyword, ```spell``` followed by the closest spelling you know for the word you want. Alfred's result list will show matches.

Hitting ```CMD + O``` for a spelling or definition result will open that word in the OS X Dictionary.app.

Hitting ```Enter``` on a result copies that word to your clipboard ready to be pasted into your documents.

## Workflows

For Alfred Power Pack users, there are even more writing tools at your disposal.

### Synonyms & Antonyms

A synonym is a word/phrase that has almost or exactly the same meaning as another word/phrase. When you want to spice up your writing, it can be useful to look synonyms of words you commonly use. The synonyms workflow is triggered with the keyword, ```synonym``` followed by the word you want to look up. Alfred's result list will show a list of synonyms ready to copy and paste into your document.

The same workflow also offers the opposite tool, an antonyms look-up. Antonyms are words that mean the opposite of another word. Just enter ```antonyms``` andd the word you want to search, Alfred's result list will display a list of antonyms.
