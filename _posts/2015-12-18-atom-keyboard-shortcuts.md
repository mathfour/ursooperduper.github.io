I dabbled with [Atom](https://atom.io) when it was in beta, but it was slow and I couldn't handle the frequent crashes and instability. But since it's reached it's 1.0 release, Atom is a joy to use and has become my default editor.

[You can check out the full Atom Cheatsheet here.](http://ursooperduper.github.io/cheatsheets/atom/)

And below are a few of my favorite Atom shortcuts:

| ----- | ----- |
| ```⇧ ⌘ D``` | Duplicate Lines |
| ```⌃ ⇧ K``` | Delete Lines |
| ```⌃ G``` | Go To Line |
| ```⌥ D``` | Delete to End of Word |
| ```⌘ L``` | Select Line |
| ```⌃ ⇧ W``` | Select Word |
| ```⇧ ⌘ F``` | Find in Project |
| ```⌃ ⌘ F``` | Toggle Fullscreen |
| ```⇧ ⌘ P``` | Toggle Command Palette |
| ```⌘ \``` | Toggle Tree View |
|  |  |
