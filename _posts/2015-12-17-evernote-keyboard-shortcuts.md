[Evernote](https://evernote.com) is my favorite tool for document writing, research, and saving bookmarks. You can organize notes into notebooks, tags, and include PDFs, images, and all sorts of formatting options. The newly redesigned web interface is minimal and a joy to work with and the desktop app make it easy to find and work with all your notes.

And below are a few of my favorite iTerm shortcuts:
