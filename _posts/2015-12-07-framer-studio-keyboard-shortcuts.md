[Framer Studio](http://framerjs.com) is my favorite prototyping tool. You can take designs you've worked on in Photoshop or Sketch, import them to Framer Studio at the click of a button and then write simple Coffeescript to bring those designs to life.

[You can check out the full Framer Studio Cheatsheet here.](http://ursooperduper.github.io/cheatsheets/framer-studio/)

And below are a few shortcuts to get you started:

| ----- | ----- |
| ```⌘ I``` |	Import |
| ```⇧ ⌘ I``` |	Import Again |
| ```⌘ R```	| Reload Preview |
| ```⇧ ⌘ F``` |	Present |
| ```⌘ D``` |	Documentation |
| ```⌥ ⌘``` |	Toggle Toolbar |
| ```⌥ ⌘ I``` |	Show Console |
|  |  |
