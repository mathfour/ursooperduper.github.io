[Tweetdeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/) is the Twitter power user's must-have tool (if you haven't jumped ship already for Tweetbot). It allows you to view your tweet timelines, lists, notifications, and more in columns, allowing you to consume more of the tweets you care about at any given time.

[You can check out the full Tweetdeck Cheatsheet here.](http://ursooperduper.github.io/cheatsheets/tweetdeck/)

And below are a few of my favorite Tweetdeck shortcuts:

| ----- | ----- |
| ```A``` | Add a Column |
| ```S``` | Search |
| ```N``` | New Tweet |
| ```⌘ ↩``` | Send New Tweet |
| ```⌫``` | Return to Main Column |
| ```L``` | Like Tweet |
| ```1-9``` | Navigate Through Columns 1-9 |
|  |  |
