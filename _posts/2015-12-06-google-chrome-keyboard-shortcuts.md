[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) is my default browser (most of the time - I still love you, Safari). It's development tools are fantastic, and it has probably the largest set of available extensions of any browser.

[You can check out the full Google Chrome Cheatsheet here.](http://ursooperduper.github.io/cheatsheets/google-chrome/)

And below are a few of my favorite Google Chrome shortcuts:

| ----- | ----- |
| ```⇧ ⌘ ⌫``` |	Clear Browsing Data |
| ```⇧ ⌘ I``` |	Email Page Location |
| ```⌘ .``` |	Stop |
| ```⇧ ⌘ F``` |	Toggle Presentation Mode |
| ```⌃ ⌘ F``` |	Toggle Fullscreen |
| ```⌥ ⌘ U``` |	View Source |
| ```⌥ ⌘ I``` |	Developer Tools |
| ```⌥ ⌘ J``` |	JavaScript Console |
|  |  |
