title: "Hacker School: Week One Wrap-up "
date: 2014-09-07

I'm currently on a train headed back to NYC, ready to start my second week of
Hacker School. I'm pretty excited to get back at it, but thought it would be
fun to reflect on the past week.

What happened in week one?
--------------------------

I was pretty nervous as I arrived at the Hacker School space last Tuesday
morning. I was so worried that I didn't have enough experience and was nervous
about letting that show. But my nerves were eased as I met everyone and
realized what a wide range of experience is represented here. Everyone is
friendly, eager to share what they're working on, and give you feedback or help
with something you're working on.

There are a good mix of intro- and extroverts. I fit somewhere in the middle,
depending on the day/weather/situation. But I'm growing a lot more comfortable
and at ease as our batch has started rolling.

On the day, after breakfast there were a few talks to explain what we should
expect over the next three months and a review the social rules, after which we
had our first check-ins.

As many engineering teams do, each day we do a check-in with a small group. There,
we share not only what we hope to do that day, but also a low and high note
from the day before.

After check-ins, we get down to work. For some, that means pairing or doing a code
review. For others, that simply means hunkering back down to move our projects forward.

A few highlights from week one:

+   A talk on floating points by co-creator of [Julia](http://julialang.org/),
[Stefan Karpinski](https://www.hackerschool.com/residents#Stefan-Karpinski). This
pretty much blew my little mind, but I learned a lot.
 +   Thursday presentations that included syntax highlighters, natural language
code generators, and, visualization apps, to name a few.
 +   I finished reading the iOS Swift Programming book and had fun experimenting
with Swift in a Playground (more on that below).

This whole thing feels like a big social experiment and I love it so far.
What happens when you let people focus on something they care about? Awesome
things.

So what did I accomplish?
-------------------------

A lot of people have been asking me what I'm going to do at Hacker School,
so I'll answer that first.

In the weeks leading up to Hacker School, I thought I'd spend my time
building computer science competencies and as
much about Ruby as I possibly could. I'm pretty comfortable with Ruby, but I
wanted to go deep with the language.
I also thought it would be fun to build an
app that would help music fans learn more about the artists in their collections
and what their collection might say about them.

But the night before Hacker School started, something new popped into my head.
In my product and design roles so far, I've never had the opportunity to focus
on mobile, and this might be the chance I'd been waiting for to get started. So
altering course slightly, my focus at will be learning how to build iOS apps -
learning Swift and Xcode.

In week one, I got my environment set up for mobile development. I started to
learn to love (and hate) Xcode, and read the Swift Programming iBook. I spent a
lot of time working through the code examples and experiments for Swift as I read.

When I finished the iBook, I started work a small first iOS project - a basic
calculator. In my next post, I'll share the code I wrote for the calculator
and explain what I did and some of the problems I encountered.

On to Week Two!
---------------
As week two starts, I hope to make one last improvement on the Calculator project
and get started on a new project where I learn about gesture recognition by
creating a children's character creator app.
