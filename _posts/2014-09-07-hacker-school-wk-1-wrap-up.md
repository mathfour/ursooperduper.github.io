title: "Hacker School: Week One Wrap-up "

I'm currently on a train headed back to NYC, ready to start my second week of
Hacker School bright and early Monday morning. I'm pretty excited to get
back at it, but thought it would be fun to reflect on the past week here.

What happened in week one?
--------------------------

I was pretty nervous as I arrived at the Hacker School space last Tuesday
morning. I felt that I didn't have enough recent experience in programming
to fit in. But my nerves and feelings of inadequecy were put to ease quickly.
First, by the incredibly friendly and welcoming Hacker School facilitators and
then the Hacker School attendees themselves. Everyone is positive, friendly, and
seem genuinely interested in what you're there to do and excited to share their
ideas and projects as well.

There are a good mix of intro- and extroverts. I fit somewhere in the middle,
which is oodles of fun. But I'm growing a lot more comfortable and at ease as
our batch has started rolling.

After breakfast and welcome talks on our first day to explain what we should
expect over the next three months and a review of our social rules, we were
ready for our first check-ins.

As many engineering teams do, each day we do a check-in with a small group. In
that check-in, we share not only what we hope to do that day, but also a low and
high note from the day before.

After check-ins, we're off to work!

Each day is just like that. But there's so much more that we have the opportunity
to do. If you want to do a code review or pair with someone on a problem, all
you have to do is ask. And everyone seems very willing to take time out of their day to work with you.

Last week, we had a pizza and games night. There was also a talk on Thursday by <>
on floating point numbers. I think I left small pieces of my brain near where I
sat for that talk.

At the end of the week, there were presentations for anyone who wanted to share
what they'd been working on that week. The work was impressive and the audience
was attentive and postiive.

This whole thing feels like a big social experiment and I love it so far.
What happens when you let people focus on something they care about? Awesome
things happens.

So what did I accomplish in week one?
-------------------------------------

A lot of people have been asking me what I'm going to do at Hacker School,
so I'll answer that first.

In the weeks leading up to Hacker School, I thought I'd spend my time
building computer science competencies and would learn as
much about Ruby as I possibly could. I'm pretty comfortable with Ruby, but I
wanted to _really_ understand how it works and go deep with the language.
I also thought it would be fun to build an
app that would help music fans learn more about the artists in their collection
and what their collection might say about them.

But the night before Hacker School started, something new popped into my head.
In my product and design roles so far, I've never had the opportunity to focus
on mobile, and this might be the chanc I'd been waiting for to get started. So
altering course slightly, I'll still work in Ruby at times, but my focus at
Hacker School will be learning how to build iOS apps - specifically learning
Swift and Xcode.

In week one, I got my environment set up for mobile development. I set up my
Apple iOS Developer account, started to learn to love (and hate) Xcode, and
read the Swift Programming iBook. I spent a lot of time working through the
code examples and experiments for Swift as I read.

When I finished the iBook, I started work a small first iOS project - a basic
calculator. In my next post, I'll share the code I wrote for the calculator
and explain what I did and some of the problems I encountered.

On to Week Two!
---------------
As week two starts, I hope to make one last improvement on the Calculator project
and get started on a new project where I learn about gesture recognition and create
a children's character creator app.
