[Sketch](http://sketchapp.com) has taken the graphic design world by storm. It's lightweight, mobile-ready, and relatively inexpensive for what it offers. With reusable elements, support for artboards and pages, and quick ways to export artwork, Sketch has become an indispensable tool for visual and user experience designers alike.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Sketch has a minimal, but well thought out set of keyboard shortcuts. From individual tool selection to general UI control, the shortcuts are easy to learn and let you stay focused on your design, not navigating UI.

But below are a few timesaving shortcuts to get you started!

Depending on the size of the display you're working with, there are times when you need to get Sketch's UI out of the way so you can see a design properly. Luckily, there are a simple set of keyboard shortcuts to make this easy.

```⌥ ⌘ 3``` (OPT + CMD + 3) toggles both the Layer List and Inspector at the same time.

From managing UI to selecting tools and arranging layers, mastering Sketch's keyboard shortcuts will speed up your work and help you discover functionality in the tool you may have overlooked!

Happy shortcutting!
