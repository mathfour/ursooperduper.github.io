Lately, I've stopped using Google Calendar in favor of the [Calendar app](http://www.apple.com/osx/apps/#calendar) on OS X El Capitan. The reason? Travel time! I can add travel time before and after an appointment giving me a much better view of my availability on any given day. That said, keyboard shortcuts are making a huge difference in my interaction with the Calendar app. Learn a few today and get started!

[You can check out the full Calendar Cheatsheet here.](http://ursooperduper.github.io/cheatsheets/calendar/)

And below are a few shortcuts to get you started:

| ----- | ----- |
| ```⌘ T``` |	Go to today's date |
| ```⇧ ⌘ T``` |	Go to a specific date |
| ```⌘ 1``` |	Switch to day view |
| ```⌘ 2``` |	Switch to week view |
| ```⌘ 3``` |	Switch to month view |
| ```⌘ 4``` |	Switch to year view |
| ```⌘ N``` |	Add a new event |
| ```⌘ E``` |	Edit the selected event |
|  |  |
