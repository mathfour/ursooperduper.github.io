[Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) is a popular bug tracking tool that can be customized to fit the unique workflow of any team. At times, working with Jira can be cumbersome, but if you learn these keyboard shortcuts, you'll find navigating bugs and tasks get so much easier.

And below are a few of my favorite Jira shortcuts:

| ----- | ----- |
| ```C``` | Create Issue |
| ```A``` | Assign Issue |
| ```M``` | Comment on Issue |
| ```G D``` | Go to Dashboard |
| ```G I``` | Find Issues |
