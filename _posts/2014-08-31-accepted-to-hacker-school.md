A few months ago, I left a comfortable job at a great start-up on the west coast,
packed a big truck with all my belongings, and moved across the country with my
partner to a small town on the east coast. And with this lifestyle change, it
was also time for a career change.

I've been working in tech for my entire career, but my roles have varied. I
started off as a web designer &amp; developer and eventually transitioned into
roles in project/program &amp; product manager. Most recently, I've been
working as a product manager and designer.  I absolutely loved the
UX design part of my job. But I grew tired of product management.
I'd also come to find that that opportunities for growth and
advancement were limited in the roles I held, especially for women. (We'll
save my feelings product management for now).

The thing about me is I love to make things. I love to draw, paint, code, make
toys, sing, play the uke, tinker, sculpt, and do whatever I can to make
something new every day. While it was exciting to help shape a product's
direction as a product manager, I really missed getting my hands dirty.

Outside of work I loved coding. I'd write little scripts to help automate some
of my daily tasks - parsing git logs and organizing bug lists, for example. I made
little apps that allowd me to experiment with platforms and technologies
that were interesting to me. I think all of that made me a better product manager
because I understood more of the technologies my teammates were working with, but
it left me with a desire to grow as a programmer.

I heard about Hacker School earlier this year and it seemed like a rare
opportunity to meet new people and focus on improving my programming skills.

I applied to Hacker School, sharing my story with them and after two
pretty wonderful interviews I was invited to join the Fall 2014
batch! The people I talked to during the interview process were awesome and
increased my excitement to be a part of such a great program. But I really  
didn't think I stood a chance of getting accepted. And yet, here I am.

Needless to say, I've jumped at the opportunity to code my little heart out for
the next few months and become better at a thing I really love. At the end of
my 3 months in NYC, I'll have some great work to show, and be ready to start
hunting down a killer programming job.

Hacker School, let's do this!
