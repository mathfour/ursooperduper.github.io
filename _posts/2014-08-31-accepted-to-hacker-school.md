A few months ago, I left a comfortable job at a great start-up on the west coast,
packed a big truck with all my belongings, and moved across the country with my
partner to a small town on the east coast.

Lifestyle wise, this was the right choice for me. I had grown tired of the city
and longed to live in a quiet town close to the sea.

Work-wise, I decided to make some changes. Over the course of my career, I've
played many roles in the companies I've worked for, from designer/developer/tech
lead, to product/program/project manager. Most recently, I'd been straddling the
fence of product management and UX design. The UX design part of my job, I loved.
However, the product management side, I'd grown weary of.

You see, I love to create things. While it was exciting to help shape a product's
direction as a product manager, I really missed being more hands on and actually
building and/or designing what I was working on.

So with my cross-country move, comes a big career change.
