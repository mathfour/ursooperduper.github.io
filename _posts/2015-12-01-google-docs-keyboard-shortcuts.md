[Google Docs](http://www.google.com/docs) has become an indispensable tool for most businesses. Your plans, dreams, and strategies live in this documents! I've only recently started working keyboard shortcuts into my Google Docs routine, but it's made a real difference!

[You can check out the full Google Docs Cheatsheet here.](http://ursooperduper.github.io/cheatsheets/google-docs/)

And below are a few of my favorite Google Docs shortcuts:

| ----- | ----- |
| ```⌘ ⇧ 7``` |	Numbered List |
| ```⌘ ⇧ 8``` |	Bulleted List |
| ```⌘ ⌥ M``` | Insert comment |
| ```⌃ ⌘, N H``` | Move to next heading |
| ```⌃ ⌘, P H``` | Move to previous heading |
| ```fn ↑``` | Page up |
| ```fn ↓``` | Page down |
|  |  |
