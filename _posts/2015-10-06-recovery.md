I'm back. It feels so incredibly good to say that. A month ago I had my last chemo infusion. And slowly, day by day, my energy and strength are returning.

I have some lingering side effects to deal with, like peripheral neuropathy and lymphedema. But I'll take those any day over chemo. Now I enter the monitoring phase - frequent oncologist visits and more frequent colonoscopies. Though without a test to state it conclusively, I say, somewhat nervously, that I'm cancer-free.

Say it with me. Cancer. Free.

I'm so grateful for all the love and support that's been shown to me this year as I went through this ordeal. Thank you. So much.

## Getting back to work

So now I'm ready to take my life back. I'm ready to get back to work. Last year, I began my transition from product management to engineering when I attended an awesome 10 week programming retreat at the [Recurse Center](http://recurse.com). I'm now actively looking for front-end development positions either remote or in the Boston-area.

To prep for my job search, I've updated this website to include work samples showing some of my professional and personal work. I'll also be getting back to blogging about my development projects. You should expect a technical post on building a Trello clone with AngularJS in the next few days. And there will be many more to come.

If you know someone looking for a great product manager or front-end developer with excellent attention to detail and an eye for design, please send them my way!

And say it with me one more time: Cancer Free!
