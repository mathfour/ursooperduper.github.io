[Skype](http://www.skype.com) is the voice and video call app we all love to hate. It's bad UX, terrible UX, and mind-numbingly painful UX make it a tool I prefer to interact with as little as possible. But when I do, I try to make use of keyboard shortcuts to get me around the (did I mention?) soul suckingly bad UX.

[You can check out the full Skype Cheatsheet here.](http://ursooperduper.github.io/cheatsheets/skype/)

And below are a few of my favorite Skype shortcuts:

| ----- | ----- |
⌘ 1	Display main Skype window
⌘ 2	Display dial pad
⌘ 3	Display contacts monitor
⌘ 4	Display Skype WiFi window
⌘ N	Open new conversation
↩	Start conversation with selected contacts
⌥ ↩	Start call with selected contacts
⌘ ⇧ E	Edit the last message you have sent
⌘ ⇧ A	Add people to the conversation
⌘ ⇧ H	End current call
⌘ ⇧ M	Mute microphone
⌘ ⇧ R	Initiate call or answer incoming call with audio
