When it comes to using Twitter on my laptop, neither Tweetdeck or the main Twitter web or desktop client really work for me. So for it's speed and features, you just can't beat [Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/).

[You can check out the full Tweetbot Cheatsheet here.](http://ursooperduper.github.io/cheatsheets/tweetbot/)

And below are a few shortcuts to get you started:

| ----- | ----- |
| ```⌘ N``` |	New Tweet |
| ```⌘ R``` |	Reply |
| ```⌘ D``` |	Direct Message |
| ```T``` |	Retweet |
| ```⌘ K``` |	Mark All As Read |
| ```→``` |	View Details |
| ```⌥ ⌘ N```	| Open in New Column |
|  |  |
