Productivity isn't always about getting work done. Sometimes it's about having more fun while you work (or coming up with the perfect gif for your blog post). This post offers some great Alfred workflows that make everyday tasks more fun!

## Movie and TV Show Search

![Alfred Workflow - Movie and TV Show Search](/images/blog/alfred/alfred-workflow-tv-firefly.png)

What was that actor in that show about the stuff? I am terrible with names - especially when it comes to show names and actors. But with this workflow you can easily get information about almost any TV show or movie. Simply type ```movie <movie name>``` or ```tv <tv show name>``` to get information about the show including its release date, list of actors, and ratings from IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic.

## Magic 8 Ball

What does the future hold? Only the Magic 8-ball truly knows. With this workflow, the wisdom of the Magic 8-ball is only a keyword away. Just enter ```8ball``` and then think of the question you want answered. Hitting enter shakes the Magic 8-ball and the Alfred result list displays the wise oracle's insightful response. Will this workflow change you life? As I see it, yes.

## Urban Dictionary

Let's face it. The older we get, the less in touch we are with current slang. If, like me, you sneak off to search strange words on [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.co/) in hopes of fitting in better with the kids, the Urban Dictionary workflow is for you. Just enter ```urb <query>``` and Alfred's result list will show definitions of that word from Urban Dictionary. Selecting a result from the list will open a browser tab with more info. Consider yourself warned.

## lulz

This workflow is pure fun. First, you can copy extremely useful emojicons to your clipboard for easy pasting. How many times have you Googled *shruggie* so you can use that perfect emojicon in a Tweet or chat room? Lots of times. That's how many. Here are the supported emojicons:

| ----- | ----- |
| ```disapproval``` | ```‡≤†_‡≤†``` |
| ```dance``` | ```‚ô™‚îè(„ÉªoÔΩ•)‚îõ‚ô™‚îó ( ÔΩ•oÔΩ•) ‚îì‚ô™``` |
| ```table``` | ```(‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª``` |
| ```cry``` | ```(¬¥‡ºé‡∫∂–î‡ºé‡∫∂`)``` |
| ```shrug``` | ```¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø``` |
| ```double table``` | ```‚îª‚îÅ‚îª Ô∏µ„ÉΩ(`–î¬¥)ÔæâÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª``` |
| ```koala``` | ``` ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î``` |
| ```unflip``` | ```‚î¨‚îÄ‚î¨„Éé( ¬∫ _ ¬∫„Éé)``` |
| ```zoidberg``` | ```(\) (¬∞,,,¬∞) (/)``` |
| ```interrobang``` | ```‚ÄΩ``` |
|  |  |

When you thought this workflow couldn't get any better, it did. Here are some other extremely useful self-explanatory features:

| ----- | ----- |
| ```fullwidth``` | ```ÔΩÜÔΩïÔΩåÔΩå„ÄÄÔΩóÔΩâÔΩÑÔΩîÔΩà„ÄÄÔΩîÔΩÖÔΩòÔΩî``` |
| ```smallcaps``` | ```Íú±·¥ç·¥Ä ü ü ·¥Ñ·¥Ä·¥òÍú± ·¥õ·¥áx·¥õ``` |
| ```upside``` | ``` áx«ù á n çod«ùd·¥âsdn``` |
|  |  |

Is this the best workflow ever?  ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î

## Emoji Codes

![Alfred Workflow - Emoji Codes](/images/blog/alfred/alfred-workflow-emoji-poop.png)

Emoji are becoming a natural [part of written language](http://www.theallusionist.org/allusionist/emoji). üò± With this workflow you can quickly look up codes for emoji and paste them in your favorite fandom chat room, important company email, or Tweet storm! Just type ```emoji``` and a keyword and you're üîëüåÖüëçüòåüçïüç©.

## Discogs Explorer

![Alfred Workflow - Discogs Explorer](/images/blog/alfred/alfred-workflow-discogs.png)

This workflow is for music fanatics. You probably know someone like this. They can tell you what year an album was released, the full names of each band member, the specific microphones used in a recording, and most importantly, that they have better taste in music than you. If you want to beef up your knowledge of favorite bands, the Discogs Explorer workflow is for you.

Just type ```dex``` followed by an artist or release name to search using the [Discogs website](http://www.discogs.com/). Search results including detailed artist and album info is displayed in Alfred's result list.

## Giphy Search

![Alfred Workflow - Giphy Search](/images/blog/alfred/alfred-workflow-giphy.png)

Writing blog posts is hard work. I struggle with finding the right GIF to express my complex emotions in each post I write.

![Mic Drop](/images/gifs/mic-drop.gif)

Luckily, there's a workflow to help you navigate the complex world of animated gifs. Using the Giphy Search workflow, just type ```gif``` and a word (reaction, emotion, tv show, etc) to open a new browser tab with the results of your [Giphy](http://giphy.com/) search!
